The principles of criminal law emphasize the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, the burden of proof resting on the prosecution, and the right to a fair trial. Additionally, criminal law addresses concepts such as criminal intent, causation, and the classification of offenses based on severity, ranging from misdemeanors to felonies.
